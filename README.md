## General Information
- To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.



<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model was trained on 9 classes and without any hyperparameter tuning accuracy was poor and model was over fitting
- After using Drop out accuracy improved and reduced over fiting Optimizer Adam usage gave better results
- Class imbalance post Augmentor gave best results
